# Capybara Tester

Sometimes it would be nice to play with capybara in a smaller context rather than through a debugger in your test suite. This will boot a sinatra app to return an HTML page, and you can then use capybara to interact with it however you want. Great for a small scale experiment.

## Installation

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec ruby tester.rb
```
